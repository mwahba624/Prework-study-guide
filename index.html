                </li>
                <li> CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
                <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
                <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
                <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share
                    pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.
                </li>
                <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a
                    class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in
                    the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
